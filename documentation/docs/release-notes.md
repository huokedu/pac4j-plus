- the JWT support has been upgraded: `SignatureConfiguration` classes allow to define HMac, RSA or Elliptic Curve signatures
- the OpenID Connect support has been upgraded: the OIDC configuration is defined via the `OidcConfiguration`, all standard claims are supported in the `OidcProfile`, most flows are supported
- CORS (AJAX) requests can be controlled via the `CorsAuthorizer` and its default pre-defined `allowAjaxRequests` name
